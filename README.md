Welcome to the world of Cell Biology :heavy_multiplication_x: ML. Here we supply the algorithms applied in our currently unpublished study: <br/>***CTRL: a label-free method for dynamic measurement of single-cell volume***.

The general flow of building and applying a CTRL system for 3D cell reconstruction and single-cell volume measurement goes as follows: 

* **1. Microdevice fabrication:** *Detailes can be found in the upcoming publication.* Please refer to our previous publication on cell volume - [YAP and TAZ regulate cell volume](http://jcb.rupress.org/content/218/10/3472)

* **2. Fluorescence Exclusion method (FXm) experiment:** *Detailes can be found in the upcoming publication.* Please refer to our previous publication on cell volume - [YAP and TAZ regulate cell volume](http://jcb.rupress.org/content/218/10/3472)

* **3. DIC and fluorescence image acquisition:** *Detailes can be found in the upcoming publication.*

* **4. Image pre-processing:** The codes are supplied in this repository.

* **5. Neural Network construction, training and validation:** The codes are supplied in this repository.

* **6. Model application:** The codes are supplied in this repository for both static single-cell volume prediction and time-lapse cell movie prediction.

We hope you find the information and resource helpful.
